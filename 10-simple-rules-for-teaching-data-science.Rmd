### 1. Teach data science by doing data analysis

**What?** In your first lesson, load the data, do some "mild" wrangling and make a plot!

**Why?** Motivation!

***

.pull-left[
.tiny[
```r
library(tidyverse)

# load the data set
can_lang <- read_csv("data/can_lang.csv")

# obtain the 10 most common Aboriginal languages
aboriginal_lang <- filter(can_lang, 
                          category == "Aboriginal languages")
arranged_lang <- arrange(aboriginal_lang, 
                         by = desc(mother_tongue))
ten_lang <- slice(arranged_lang, 1:10)

# create the visualization
ggplot(ten_lang, aes(x = mother_tongue,
                     y = reorder(language, mother_tongue))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Mother Tongue (Number of Canadian Residents)") +
  ylab("Language") 
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r nachos-to-cheesecake-1, out.width="100%", fig.align="left", fig.retina=2}
knitr::include_graphics("img/nachos-to-cheesecake-1.png")
```

### 2. Use participatory live coding!

**What?** Narrate and type out the code you are teaching. Have participants follow along.

**Why?** Demonstrates process and makes you appear human!

---

### 3. Give tons and tons of practice!

**What?** Give the learners many many problems to solve.

**Why?** Repetition leads to learning!

***

Read the data files listed in the table below and and bind the names listed in the table to them.

| File  | Object name to bind to the data frame | File location |
|---|---|----|
| `abbotsford_lang.xlsx`  | `abbotsford` | `data` directory of this repo |
| `calgary_lang.csv`  | `calgary`  | `data` directory of this repo |
| `edmonton_lang.xlsx`  | `edmonton`  | https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/tree/master/inst/extdata |
|  `kelowna_lang.csv` | `kelowna`  | `data` directory of this repo |
| `vancouver_lang.csv`  | `vancouver`  | `data` directory of this repo |
| `victoria_lang.csv`  | `victoria`  | https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/tree/master/inst/extdata |

### 4. Give tons and tons of timely feedback!

**What?** Automated software tests to give hints and feedback.

**Why?** Effective practice requires feedback!

***

```{r tests-as-feedback, out.width="70%", fig.retina=2, fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tests-as-feedback.png")
```

## 5. Use tractable or toy data examples

**What?** Use a countable number of things when teaching a new tool, method or algorithm.

**Why?** Allows one to see how all the elements are manipulated.

***

A small subset of the `palmerpengiuns` data set for teaching K-means clustering:

```{r 10-toy-example-clustering-1, out.width="35%", fig.retina=2}
knitr::include_graphics("img/10-toy-example-clustering-1.png")
```

.pull-left[

```{r jenny-dplyr-join-tweet, out.width="100%", fig.retina=2}
knitr::include_graphics("img/jenny-dplyr-join-tweet.png")
```

.small[
```r
left_join(superheroes, publishers)
```
]

We basically get `x = superheroes` back, but with the addition of variable `yr_founded`, which is unique to `y = publishers`. Hellboy, whose publisher does not appear in `y = publishers`, has an `NA` for `yr_founded`.

```{r jenny-bryan-left-join, out.width="100%", fig.retina=2}
knitr::include_graphics("img/jenny-bryan-left-join.png")
```

## 6. Use real and rich, but accessible, data sets

**What?** Use real and interesting data that is also easily understood by all.

**Why?** Motivating! 

***

```{r README-example-plot-from-data-1, out.width="70%", fig.retina=2, fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/README-example-plot-from-data-1.png")
```

Source: [`canlang`](https://ttimbers.github.io/canlang/) R package
---
.pull-left[
Jenny Bryan's [`gapminder`](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder) R data package:

| variable  | meaning                  |
| :-------- | :----------------------- |
| country   |                          |
| continent |                          |
| year      |                          |
| lifeExp   | life expectancy at birth |
| pop       | total population         |
| gdpPercap | per-capita GDP           |
]

.pull-right[
```{r gapminder, fig.height=5}
# source: https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder
# for convenience, integrate the country colors into the data.frame
library(gapminder)
library("ggplot2")

ggplot(subset(gapminder, continent != "Oceania"),
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country, color = country)) +
  geom_line(lwd = 1, show.legend = FALSE) + facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  scale_color_manual(values = country_colors) +
  theme_bw() + theme(strip.text = element_text(size = rel(1.1))) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)")
```

## 7. Provide cultural and historical context

**What?** When software things seem "odd", take time to explain why they are the way they are.

**Why?** Cultivates an appreciation, or at least understanding of software's quirks. Helps prevent frustration and/or annoyances. Helps with motivation again!

***

When teaching programming with the `tidyverse`, 
I make sure to introduce R's history and it's design purpose, 
so that the role and rationale for unquoted column names is clear:

>#### Now, a bit of history about R
>- An implementation of the S programming language (created at Bell labs in 1976)
>- written in C, Fortran, and R itself
>- R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (Statisticians from NZ)
>- R is named partly after the authors and partly as a play on the name of S
>- First stable beta version in 2000

## 8. Build a safe, inclusive and welcoming community

**What?** Put in place scaffolding and guidelines to facilitate a safe learning environment.

**Why?** Students cannot effectively learn if they do not feel safe.

### 9. Use checklists to focus and facilitate peer learning

**What?** Focus and provide structure to student peer review by providing them review checklists.

**Why?** Peer review is hard and often new to many. Also reviewing something you are new at is even harder! What to focus on?

***

##### Data analysis review checklist:

.pull-left[
```{r da-review-checklist-1, out.width="85%", fig.retina=2}

## 10. Have students do projects

**What?** Have students perform a (scoped) data analysis project on a topic of their choosing.

**Why?** Motivation and exposure to the messiness of real data analysis.
