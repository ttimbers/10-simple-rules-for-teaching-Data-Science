# 10 simple rules for teaching Data Science 

Tiffany A. Timbers & Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel <br>

Here we present 10 simple rules we follow when teaching Data Science. 
These rules have been largely learned from others in the 
data science and computational education community. 
We have trialed and tested them in our teaching of Data Science
in both undergraduate and graduate Data Science courses 
at the University of British Columbia and Duke University.
