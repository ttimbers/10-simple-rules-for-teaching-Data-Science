# 10 simple rules for teaching Data Science 

Tiffany A. Timbers <br>
Talk for 2023 International Day of Women in Statistics and Data Science (IDWSDS 2023)

This talk will present 10 simple rules I follow when teachingData Science. 
These rules have been largely learned from others in the 
data science and computational education community. 
I have trialed and tested them in my teaching of Data Science throughout the past 6 years 
in both undergraduate and graduate Data Science courses at the University of British Columbia.
