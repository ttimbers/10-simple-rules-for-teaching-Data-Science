This article focuses on computer science teachersÂ´ examination of instructional methods supporting knowledge processes in the act of learning. A survey was conducted in which computer science teachers evaluated 20 instructional methods in regard to the following knowledge processes: Build, process, apply, transfer, assess and integrate. The results of the study show that certain instructional methods are especially predestined for computer science education: Problem-based learning, learning tasks, discovery learning, computer simulation, project work and direct instruction.},
